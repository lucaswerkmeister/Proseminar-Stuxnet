Interessant:
Stuxnet records a timestamp, along with other system information, within itself each time a new infection occurs. Thus, each sample has a history of every computer that was infected, including the first infection.
(Page 7 / L273)
In one case, time between compilation and first infection was only 12 hours!

Stuxnet does not install if:
- 64-bit (Page 16)
- after 06/24/2012 (Page 17)
- Registry key set to certain value (Page 18)
- after another date in config file (Page 18)

Win32k.sys Privilege Escalation (Page 19):
- instruct Win32k.sys to load malformed keyboard layout file
- loading procedure includes function table, with index not properly validated
- evil index from malformed file points outside table, to some data (of Win32k.sys)
- at content address of that data, stuxnet had written a jump to allocated memory
- Win32k.sys then jumps in function table, to that jump, to allocated memory
- that allocated memory is run with escalated privileges â€“ profit
- restore original keyboard layout, delete malformed keyboard layout file
