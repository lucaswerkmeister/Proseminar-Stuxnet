Interessant:
Stuxnet records a timestamp, along with other system information, within itself each time a new infection occurs. Thus, each sample has a history of every computer that was infected, including the first infection.
(Page 7 / L273)
In one case, time between compilation and first infection was only 12 hours!

Stuxnet does not install if:
- 64-bit (Page 16)
- after 06/24/2012 (Page 17)
- Registry key set to certain value (Page 18)
- after another date in config file (Page 18)

Win32k.sys Privilege Escalation (Page 19):
- instruct Win32k.sys to load malformed keyboard layout file
- loading procedure includes function table, with index not properly validated
- evil index from malformed file points outside table, to some data (of Win32k.sys)
- at content address of that data, stuxnet had written a jump to allocated memory
- Win32k.sys then jumps in function table, to that jump, to allocated memory
- that allocated memory is run with escalated privileges – profit
- restore original keyboard layout, delete malformed keyboard layout file

Possible implications about the attackers:
- Page 18:
  - Infection aborts if certain registry value = 19790509
  - Might be May 9, 1979
  - On that day, new Islamic Iranian government executed first Jew, prompting mass exodus of Jewish community of Iran
- Page 24:
  - Unobfuscated project file path b:\myrtus\src\objfre_w2k_x86\i386\guava.pdb
  - Guavas are in the Myrtle (lat. Myrtus) genus
  - myrtus = MyRTUs? RTU = Remote Terminal Unit, in some places = PLC
  - Myrtle = hebr. Hadassah, Hadassah is other name of Esther (see OT)
  - Pretty fucked up story, really
    - Hadassah is wife of King Ahasuerus / Xerxes I
    - she learns of plot for all Jews to be killed (King declared them “vogelfrei” for one day, not knowing his wife is Jewish)
    - pleads with King, result: Jews may defend themselves (King cannot retract law), result: would-be executioners + 75.000 persians killed, result: holiday of Purim
    - complicated stuff, if I really want to include this I should probably actually read the book instead of the Wikipedia summary
Not sure what the implication would be. Jewish-Iranian enmity? Israel attacker? US attacker, good Israel-US relations? ?? ???
Probably waaaay too hot and unsure (and untechnical)
