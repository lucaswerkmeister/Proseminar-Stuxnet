Interessant:
Stuxnet records a timestamp, along with other system information, within itself each time a new infection occurs. Thus, each sample has a history of every computer that was infected, including the first infection.
(Page 7 / L273)
In one case, time between compilation and first infection was only 12 hours!

Stuxnet does not install if:
- 64-bit (Page 16)
- after 06/24/2012 (Page 17)
- Registry key set to certain value (Page 18)
- after another date in config file (Page 18)

Win32k.sys Privilege Escalation (Page 19):
- instruct Win32k.sys to load malformed keyboard layout file
- loading procedure includes function table, with index not properly validated
- evil index from malformed file points outside table, to some data (of Win32k.sys)
- at content address of that data, stuxnet had written a jump to allocated memory
- Win32k.sys then jumps in function table, to that jump, to allocated memory
- that allocated memory is run with escalated privileges – profit
- restore original keyboard layout, delete malformed keyboard layout file

autorun.inf (Page 31-32):
- Windows autorun.inf parser is very forgiving: skips until valid autorun command is found
- Stuxnet autorun.inf = cat stuxnet_executable actual_autorun.inf
- autorun.inf instructs Windows to auto-run the autorun.inf file itself (which is a legal executable, see above)
- Also adds new context menu entry to drive, called “Open” (but taken from shell32.dll, so presumably localized?).
  Context menu now contains two Opens, one launches Stuxnet (then real Open to avoid suspicion)

Propagation (Page 25-):
- removable drives
  - LNK (Page 29-30) – only 1.10x
  - Autorun.inf (Page 30-32) – only 1.001
  - Step7 projects – see below
- network:
  - peer-to-peer (Page 25-26) – only updates
  - WinCC (Page 26-27)
  - Print Spooler (Page 27-28)
  - SMB (Page 28)
  - Mailslots (0.5 Page 5) – only updates, only 0.5
  - File shares (0.5 Page 5) – only updates, only 0.5
- Step7 projects
  - S7P files (Page 33-34)
  - MCP files (Page 34) – unclear if this can infect a clean system
  - TMP files (Page 34-35) – only updates
  - Note:
    - Only “suitable” files are infected
    - Infect loaded Step7 projects: All versions
    - Infect Step7 projects on removable drives: Only 0.5

Possible implications about the attackers:
- Page 18:
  - Infection aborts if certain registry value = 19790509
  - Possibly significant date
- Page 24:
  - Unobfuscated project file path b:\myrtus\src\objfre_w2k_x86\i386\guava.pdb
  - Guavas are in the Myrtle (lat. Myrtus) genus
  - myrtus = MyRTUs? RTU = Remote Terminal Unit, in some places = PLC
  - Myrtle = hebr. Hadassah, Hadassah is other name of Esther (see OT)
Generally very difficult to decipher, and attackers would want to implicate other party –
don’t expand upon, at most mention in passing.
